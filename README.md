# Aquavias Project

The Aquavias project is a Java-based implementation of a puzzle game where players rotate and align pipe tiles on a grid to create a continuous water flow from source to destination. Featuring an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Swing, the game offers interactive elements such as  water flow visualization, and level progression. Using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, the project ensures clean separation of game logic, user interface, and input handling for maintainability and extensibility. Players can engage with multiple difficulty levels, save and load game states, and optionally track moves or time for scoring. The game provides an engaging and educational experience while demonstrating advanced Java programming principles and GUI design.
